Application Objectives
            When user run this application by going to VirtualKey folder and AppStart.java class, the application 	displays first menu which included bellow details. 

########################### First Menu   ############################
  	 ======> 1, To display all files, press 1
  	 ======> 2, To go to second menu, press 2
   	======> 3, To quite this application, press 3

	If user press 1, the application will display all files if there are any files in MainFolder directory.
	If user press 2, the application will take the user to the second menu. 
	If user press 3, the application will stop and exit user from using this application. 
	     
Core Concept of Application 
	The core concept of this application is to learn bellow concepts.
How to create java application using IDE. 
How to use java Scanner library and System.in 
How to use java loops, if statements, switch statements, try catch exception handler, functions, searching algorithms, file handler, and GitHub. 
	
Sprint Planning of Application 
                  
	Virtual Key application will be completed in two sprints.
	Sprint 1
Create GitHub account. 
Create Virtual Key project in Intellij. 
Create Flow Chart 
Create Java AppStarter class. 
Create Java MenuController class. 

Sprint 2
Create Specification document. 
Create Java FileController class. 
Test the functional of the application with different inputs. 
Test the application and fix any bugs if exists before delivery. 
Create Specification document. 
Add the Virtual Key project into GitHub repository. 
Add GitHub link into Specification document.

Algorithm of Application 

	In this application I used Merge sort algorithm to sort files alphabetically and to search the files        	I used linear search algorithm. 

Flow Chart of Application
     




Conclusion
       Enhancing application  
Application can be improved if we create GUI. 
Application can be improved if we limit user input 3 times only for security.
